
## Code Review 11

Your assignment was to create several plots following a set of instructions. 
You could use either toyplot, matplotlib, or another plotting tool. For your
code-review see the table below for which of your peer's notebooks to review. 
As usual, if their assignment notebook is not available then choose any other one. 

Find your assigned notebook and open it in GitHub for viewing. You can write
your code review in a notebook or using markdown in a text editor. 
Add your assignment file to the code-review directory as 
`code-review/<username>-code-review-11.md>`, push it to your repo
when you are finished and make a pull request to the class remote. 


+ [Problem 1]. Combining scatterplot coordinates with further styling of the
markers using size or color variation can provide additional information about the points. In this plot, the y position should correspond with the size of markers. Do you think this is a useful way to emphasize information in a plot?
Could it possibly be misinterpreted or misleading in some way? Did your peer
create plot as instructed, and did they use the same method as you?


+ [Problem 2]. Here points are also colored using a colormap mapping to the x value of the points, and the size is random. There is not likely to be a good reason to make the size of points random in a real plot, but it does make for an interesting looking figure here. Think of and describe an example scatterplot in which there are 4 values you wish to represent, and you would use size, color, and x, and y coordinates to display information about all four. 


+ [Problem 3]. Modifying the placement of tick marks and axes labels is often
a difficult task, and is done a bit differently in every plotting library. It is
important that ticks marks are spaced out and made to an appropriate size to be
readable. Did your peer add tick marks as described? Did they use a different method than you did? 


+ [Problem 4]. Barplots are used to show a distribution of binned data points. 
The default styling of barplots is often used, but modifying the size of bins, 
their color, or the spacing between them can often make for a much nicer looking
plot. Did your peer bin the data into 15 bins? Did they apply a colormap to the 
bars? Given this distribution, which type of colormap do you think would be most
appropriate, i.e., a linear map, a diverging map? 


+ [Problem 5]. Creating plot layouts that combine multiple plots onto a single
canvas is an important skill to learn to begin to make complex plots that display
a lot of information. This plot should show a histogram on the left, and a 
corresponding scatterplot on the right. The density of points should match up 
between the two. Which of the two plots do you think is more informative about
the distribution of the data? Did your peer use a different method than you did,
and how do they differ?
