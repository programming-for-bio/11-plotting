    "1. Yes, using the y-position to represent the size of markers is an interesting to represent information. It could be misleading at times when the y-position also refers to data for a particular variable. The author's code carried out the execution of the scatterplot just the way I have done so.   \n",

    "2. Four values that I would like to see in a scatterplot are the size of the markers (as shown in the legend. For instance, do varying sizes refer to the magnitude of the datasets themselves?), the color (which could be a gradient or categorical sets of colors based on the information that one is trying to convey) and the x and y coordinates, which represent the information for the predictors that one is trying to plot. \n",

    "4. Yes, my peer binned the bar plot into 15 bins and they applied a colormap. A linear map would be more appropriate\n",

    "5. The barplot on the left is more informative than the scatterplot on the right. My peer used the same method as I did. "
